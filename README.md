# Dotfiles

The growing collection of my dotfiles. Feel free to fork, use or improve.

Some important notes:
 
 - Most things are done with Debian/Ubuntu in mind. The configurations should probably work on other systems too, but that has never been tested.
 - I work on noth Linux and Windows environments. Therefore, the configuration in `windows` is meant to get some stuff like the Pure promt working on Windows Ubuntu subsystem. Everything else comes with Linux first in mind, but should always be done in a way that does not break my environment when working on a Windows machine.
